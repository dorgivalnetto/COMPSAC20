<b>Abstract</b>

<b>[Background]</b> Software requirements are usually specifiedin Natural Language, bringing challenges for Requirements Engineering (RE) as these specifications are inherently ambiguous. These challenges become bigger when dealing with software requirements that must comply with regulations,the so-called legal requirements. The state of practice totackle ambiguity of legal requirements and their compliance with regulations is missing.<b>[Goal]</b> This work investi-gates how ambiguity in legal requirements specification isaddressed and how the software development industry per-forms legal compliance.[Method]We followed a qualitativeapproach based on semi-structured interviews involving nineprofessionals from different companies who presented theirviews on the RE process, including legal compliance and am-biguity resolution of legal requirements. Data was collectedusing audio-recorded and analyzed using Grounded Theory.[Results]Findings revealed that customer and legal expertsupport during the project could reduce the risk of misinter-preting the legislation. Verification and Validation of LegalCompliance are customer assignments.[Conclusions]Am-biguity resolution and legal compliance of requirements arebased on the tacit knowledge of experienced team membersor discussions between the team and the customer.
