<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
<b>[Background]</b> Software requirements are usually specifiedin Natural Language, bringing challenges for Requirements Engineering (RE) as these specifications are inherently ambiguous. These challenges become bigger when dealing with software requirements that must comply with regulations,the so-called legal requirements. The state of practice totackle ambiguity of legal requirements and their compliance with regulations is missing.<b>[Goal]</b> This work investigates how ambiguity in legal requirements specification is addressed and how the software development industry performs legal compliance. <b>[Method]</b> We followed a qualitativeapproach based on semi-structured interviews involving nine professionals from different companies who presented their views on the RE process, including legal compliance and ambiguity resolution of legal requirements. Data was collected using audio-recorded and analyzed using Grounded Theory.<b>[Results]</b> Findings revealed that customer and legal expert support during the project could reduce the risk of misinterpreting the legislation. Verification and Validation of Legal Compliance are customer assignments.<b>[Conclusions]</b> Ambiguity resolution and legal compliance of requirements are based on the tacit knowledge of experienced team members or discussions between the team and the customer.</p>

  <h3>Data Collection</h3>
  
  <p align="justify"> A semi-structured interview was performed using an interview script specifically designed and composed of open-ended questions</p>

  <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
  
  <p align="justify"> Considered labeled portions of text using codes (we started with open coding, then we did axial coding, and finally, weused selective coding). </p>

<p align="justify"> Subsequently, the relationships between categories were mapped to identify their influences about the requirements specification process with reduced ambiguity and legal compliance. Figure 1 illustrates the category creation process.</p>

<p align="justify"> Four basic categories (<i>Requirements Elicitation</i>, <i>Requirements Specification</i>, <i>Working with Law</i>, <i>Sensitive Personal Data</i>) and three core categories (<i>Communication between the Team and the Customer</i>, <i>Legal Requirements</i> and, <i>Ambiguity</i>) were found. The core categories are highlighted by the rectangle with the dashed border in red. The arrows that relate a factor to a category have a signal plus or minus representing, respectively, positive or negative influences from the factors to these categories. For example, <i>Change in the Law</i> is a negative factor for those <i>Working with Law</i> because this change has an impact on the processes. The contribution (positive or negative) of each category over the main categories were derived from the interpretation of the interviews and authors’ analysis data. The smaller bidirectional arrows between the categories represent that they were associated with the interviews. The larger bidi-rectional arrows connecting only core categories, represent the relationships with higher importance, i.e., to address ambiguity in legal requirements, the <i>Communication between the Team and the Customer</i> is critical. To ensure a successful <i>Requirements Elicitation</i> and <i>Requirements Specification</i>, <i>Communication between the Team and the Customer</i> is critical. Figure 2 presents the categories and their related factors. </p>
